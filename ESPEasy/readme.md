## prebuild firmware

in the folder **firmware** you will find recent beta builds of my work. Feel free to test. Comments are always welcome

## initial config

The fastest and easiest way to do the initial config after flashing the firmware is to open your terminal and paste these commands
```
WifiSSID <your SSID>
WifiKey <your password>
Save
WifiConnect
```
with the command `ip` you can get the ip-address of your ESP8266 after wifi connect.
